# Welcome!

I have created two web based CTF challenges for your entertainment. If you are unfamiliar with what a CTF is in a security context then here is a quick overview from [ctfd.io](https://ctfd.io/whats-a-ctf/):
> Jeopardy CTFs are the most common kind of CTF.
They revolve around a set of challenges which are provided by competition organizers to competitors.
Competitors form teams and then work on the challenges together.
Each challenge is designed so that when the competitor solves it, a small piece of text or "flag" is revealed. The flag is then submitted to a website or scoring engine in exchange for points. The amount of points rewarded is typically relative to the perceived difficulty of the challenge.
Competitors usually receive about 72 hours (typically the course of a weekend) to solve as many challenges as possible.

The general approach for CTF challenges is to first understand the system you are given, in this case it is a web application. Go through and discover its functionality, what technologies it uses and what other systems it interacts with. Once you have that understanding, then you must think like an attacker! How can you break away from the intended use cases set before you in the application? Think outside the box!

Here are a few resources to get you started around tools and tricks you can use when solving CTF challenges:
- https://book.hacktricks.xyz/welcome/readme - A lot of great tricks for all types of CTF challenges
- https://portswigger.net/web-security - Covers just about every major web vulnerability, and has free labs to go with it.
- https://portswigger.net/burp/communitydownload - HTTP Intercepting Proxy. Extremely useful in web challenges allowing you to edit and replay HTTP requests.


Each challenge has two flags for you to find. The flags will be in the format `flag{flag_text_here}` so you'll know when you find it.

Please reach out to me if you want any hints, or just have any questions. I want this to be an enjoyable experience, and leave you feeling like you learned something along the way.

So without further ado, here are the challenges:

## Tetris Temple
Love tetris? So do I! I found this website that allows you to play in your browser, and customize the block colors! I wonder how they are doing that? Well anyways, here it is: http://tetris.doshmajhan.com. Have fun playing!

## Security Theatre
My favorite kind of theatre. I hear they have some fantastic screenings at the moment. Make sure to go the ticket booth to get your ticket first: http://ticketbooth.doshmajhan.com but mind the auth... Enjoy the shows!
